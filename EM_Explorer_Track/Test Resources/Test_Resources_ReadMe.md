# EM Tools – CBECC Reference Models

This folder contains a set of verified CBECC project models intended for use across all EM Tools development tracks. These files are provided as **read-only reference inputs** and should not be modified or used to generate output unless explicitly requested.

## 📁 Contents

The following ZIP archives each represent a complete CBECC simulation folder, including model files and results:

- Bressi Ranch.zip
- Del Amo.zip
- Euclid.zip
- Freedom.zip
- MPMP3.zip

## 🧪 Intended Use

These models are used to:

- Validate CBECC-to-IDF translation logic
- Test CBECC-to-IESVE geometry + system mapping
- Cross-reference simulation outputs across EM Tools modules
- Serve as standard datasets for test harnesses

## 🚫 Not for Commit to GitHub

These files are large and should not be stored in the repository. They are retained separately in Dropbox under:

```
/EM_Explorer/Test_Resources/CBECC_Models/
```

## 🔒 Maintained By

These models are maintained by the project owner (David Magarian) and made available only for internal development and validation use.

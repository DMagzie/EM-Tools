## ðŸš€ How to Use

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 dropbox_refresh_token_generator_final.py
   ```

3. Follow the instructions:
   - A browser will open with a Dropbox login/authorize screen
   - Copy the URL or use the code returned in your browser
   - Paste the code into the terminal prompt

4. The script will:
   - Retrieve your `access_token` and `refresh_token`
